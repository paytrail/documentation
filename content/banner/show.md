Paytrail offers a dynamic image (_banner_) of the payment methods available in the web store. The image is meant to be used on the front page of the store, and includes information of all payment methods available through Paytrail's service. If new payment methods are activated, the logos are automatically updated in the banner.

The dimensions and layout of the image can be modified with parameters `type` and `cols`.

- `type` defines whether a horizontal or vertical image should be used.
- `cols` defines the number of columns available in the image. Each column is used to show a single payment method. Some payment method images require 2 columns.
