Paytrail offers a dynamic image (_banner_) of the payment methods available which can be used on the website. The image is meant to be used on the front page for e-commerce websites, and includes all payment methods available through Paytrailâ€™s service. If new payment methods are activated, the logos are automatically updated in the banner.
