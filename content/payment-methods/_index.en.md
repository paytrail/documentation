This chapter introduces payment method specific settings. Field `PAYMENT_METHODS` for selecting and hiding methods and list of special payment method specific restrictions is found here in a table.

Field `PAYMENT_METHODS` is a comma separated list of payment methods visible at payment method selection page. If only one is set the payment method page is bypassed and payer is directed to payment method provider page.

Payment page bypass is a premium feature (agreement update required) that enables the selection of the payment method already in the web shop. When using bypass, the customer is directed to the selected payment service without visibly passing through Paytrail's service.
