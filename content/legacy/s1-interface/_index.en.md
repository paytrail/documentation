> Interface has been deprecated. We recommend using [E2][e2] interface for creating payments.

This is how a website communicates with the payment gateway with S1 interface. The payment data is created as a form on the web applications page. The consumer sends this form to the payment service. The payment is then completed in the web browser as an immediate result of the customer's actions.
