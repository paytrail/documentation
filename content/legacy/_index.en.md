We recommend our [**E2**][e2] interface for all payment service needs, if thatâ€™s not an option we still support the [**REST**][rest] interface.

[**E1**][e1] and [**S1**][s1] interfaces have been deprecated.

[e2]: {{< ref "payments" >}}
[rest]: {{< ref "legacy/rest-interface" >}}
[e1]: {{< ref "legacy/e1-interface" >}}
[s1]: {{< ref "legacy/s1-interface" >}}
