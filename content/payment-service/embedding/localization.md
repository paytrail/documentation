The payment method selection page embedding supports the following localizations:

- `fi_FI` (_Finnish_)
- `en_US` (_English_)
- `da_DK` (_Danish_)
- `de_DE` (_German_)
- `et_EE` (_Estonian_)
- `fr_FR` (_French_)
- `ru_RU` (_Russian_)
- `sv_SE` (_Swedish_)
  
The traditional payment method selection page supports only `fi_FI`, `en_US`, and `sv_SE`.

{{% notice note %}}Payment method provider services only support localizations fi_FI, en_US and sv_SE or a subset of those. If the customer has selected such a localization that is not supported by the payment method provider service, localization en_US is preferred.{{% /notice %}}
