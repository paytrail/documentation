We offer a PHP package for creating payments with the E2 interface easily. You can import the package to your project with **Composer** like so:

```sh
composer require paytrail/e2-module
```

The package requires **PHP 7.2** or newer. The detailed documentation is available on [**GitHub**][e2-gh] and [**Packagist**][e2-packagist].

If you encounter any problems using the package don't hesitate reporting them to us in GitHub. You can also participate in the package development by submitting us pull requests.

If you would rather build your own integration, see the chapters in this section for more details.
